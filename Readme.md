# Goolang ransomware

### This program is a demonstration of a basic ransomware tool. It performs two main tasks:


Display ASCII Art Donut: 

- Upon execution, the program launches a goroutine to display an ASCII art donut in the terminal. This donut is fetched from the website ascii.live/donut using the curl command.

Encrypt File: 
- Simultaneously, another goroutine encrypts a target file specified by the user. The default folder to encrypt is `/test`, but the user can provide a different file path as a command-line argument. The encryption process is done using a predefined encryption key.

After both tasks are completed, the program terminates. Additionally, it kills any remaining processes spawned during its execution.

To run (the path argument is optional):

    go run main.go [input_file_path]

To compile (on root folder):

    go build main.go

Execute .exe from terminal
    
    /.main.go [input_file_path]
