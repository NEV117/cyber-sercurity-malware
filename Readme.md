# Goolang rasomewere

### This program is a demonstration of a basic ransomware tool. It performs two main tasks:


Display ASCII Art Donut: 

- Upon execution, the program launches a goroutine to display an ASCII art donut in the terminal. This donut is fetched from the website ascii.live/donut using the curl command.

Encrypt File: 
- Simultaneously, another goroutine encrypts a target file specified by the user. The default file to encrypt is `test.txt`, but the user can provide a different file path as a command-line argument. The encryption process is done using a predefined encryption key.

After both tasks are completed, the program terminates. Additionally, it kills any remaining processes spawned during its execution.

To run (on root folder) the path argument is optional:

    go run main.go [input_file_path]

To compile (on root folder):

    go build main.go

Execute .exe from terminal
    
    /.main.go [input_file_path]
